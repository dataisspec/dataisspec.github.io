        <p>
          The process of developing self-driving delivery robots that can
          safely navigate urban environments has required us to solve many
          complex problems. In doing so, we developed and refined a process
          for efficiently and effectively solving these problems. We want to
          share the generalized version of this process and the journey we took
          to get there.
        </p>
        <p>
          We used to believe that solving complex problems was about forming
          a complete understanding of the problem and specifying its solution.
          The advent of machine learning has shown it to be possible
          to solve them by optimizing directly against data without
          fully understanding the problem nor the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          This way of thinking can be applied more generally,
          in software development and in many other fields.
          We believe superhuman solutions can be achieved by finding the
          easiest subset of problems, solving it, and repeating as many
          times as necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of all our collected experiences,
          we have extracted <strong>three core principles</strong>:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Instead of coming up with a good general solution,
            it is better to focus on solving specific cases of the problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instead of trying to solve all problematic cases right away,
            it is better to address a third of the easiest cases and repeat
            the process multiple times.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instead of writing a good specification of the solution,
            it is better to curate a collection of problem cases.
            This collection of problem cases then <b>becomes</b> your specification.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          In the early days of developing this technology at Starship,
          our robots were accompanied by a human in public areas -
          just like self-driving car companies are doing right now.
          This was because our technology was not yet good enough to
          operate without supervision.
          By 2017, our technology had taken major steps forward,
          meaning our smart six-wheelers could operate in public spaces on
          their own. We were the first company to accomplish this.
        </p>
        <p>
          To allow a robot to drive unsupervised, you need to ensure safety
          for the robots and the people with whom they interact.
          To make sure of this, we started measuring and quantifying
          our safety metrics long before 2017. The first results were 250
          times short of our targets. Clearly, we had some work to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improving something by 250x is an audacious goal -
          but the best startups are, by their nature, audacious.
          Our process to improve safety dramatically was methodical
          and incremental. We made a list of occasions where the robot did
          not behave in an ideal manner. From this, we took the worst 100
          and tried to solve half of them by any means possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This focus on taking on the lowest-hanging fruit first produced
          marked improvements. Within a few months, our robots were, according
          to our metrics, performing twice as safely and efficiently as they
          were before we began the improvement process.
        </p>
        <p>
          We repeated this process about ten times and eventually reached our
          goal of 250x improvement. The journey included steps we would have
          never thought of in the beginning. Sometimes the solution was as easy
          as fixing simple but hard-to-find bugs that caused our robots to
          not detect approaching cars. On other occasions, the solutions were
          not about software, but about changing the processes determining
          how humans interact with the robots (we intentionally have remote
          operators occasionally oversee robots, in especially demanding places,
          over a video link). Other times the solution was to add
          new sensors to the robot. Not because these sensors were "better"
          in terms of their general capability, but because they solved a
          handful of real-life cases that didn’t have other solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our manifesto is an extension of test-driven development, where
          instead of manually written test cases, you test against real historical
          data. Agile and Lean methodologies, along with data-driven decision
          making, also focus on the iterative application of the
          build-measure-learn loop, but we believe in even faster iteration cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The knowledge-aggregation and solution-creation processes can be
          improved by iterating directly against data itself, as we suggest
          above. In doing so, you don’t need to write specifications,
          and you don’t lose vital data about what is really happening.
          This can lead you to a long-term all-round understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope you find this manifesto useful in your own work. If you want to discuss any of it with us, or find out more about our problem-solving journey, get in touch with us.
